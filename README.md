These are some completions for pamac. 

I'm by no means a pamac power user, so this is a pretty minimalist set of completions, which only contains a small fraction of all the options.
## Install
This might not work since I never registered this package, but you should be able to install it just from this git repo

```fish
$ omf install pamac-completions # or
omf install https://github.com/TransientError/pamac-fish-completions
```


## Usage

```fish
$ pamac-completions
```
